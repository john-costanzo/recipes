* Baron Bagels

** Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 5 cups bread flour
- 2 teaspoons salt, plus more for boiling
- 1 tablespoon diastatic malt powder
- Â¼ cup poppy seeds, optional
- Â¼ cup sesame seeds, optional

** Method
1. Put the yeast in the bowl of a standing mixer. Add 1â…” cups lukewarm water and allow the yeast to activate, about 5 minutes. Add flour, salt and malt powder and mix at low speed for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment. Cover the dough and allow to rise at room temperature for about 2 hours.
2. Punch the dough down and shape into a rough rectangle about 1 to 1Â½ inches thick, and about 2 times longer than it is wide. If you are having trouble forming the dough, stretch it, wait for the gluten to relax and reform.
3. Cut the dough into 10 pieces of about 3 ounces each. Roll each into an 8-inch-long snakelike shape, tapering the dough at each end. Circle the dough around your hand, pinching the ends together and rolling under your palm once or twice to seal. Put the bagels on a Silpat or other nonstick baking sheet on top of a jellyroll pan. Cover well with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 10 hours, or up to 24 hours.
4. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. If you have a baking stone or brick you use for baking, put it on a rack near the bottom of the oven; it will retain heat and produce a crisper bagel. Bring a large pot of water to boil, throw a handful of salt into the boiling water and remove the bagels from the refrigerator.
5. Using your hands, carefully place just enough bagels into the pot to cover the surface of the water, making sure that there are no bagels resting on top of one another. Let them float on one side for about 30 seconds before flipping them to the other side for another 30 seconds or so. Remove the bagels and drain well on a cooling rack.
6. Pour poppy or sesame seeds into a bowl wider than the bagels. Working very quickly, remove the bagels one by one and dip them into the topping. Place them back on the Silpat-covered baking sheet, topping side down.
7. Bake on the second to highest shelf of the oven for about 7 minutes. Then flip the bagels and continue baking for about 8 minutes, or until they are golden brown.

* Buttermilk Scones with Raisins
By Donna Pilato, About.com
- It's difficult to picture a tea party that doesn't have at least one scone on the menu. Here is a simple recipe for buttermilk scones that turn out fluffy and buttery in absolutely no time. They're best served warm from the oven, but are still pretty tasty the following day.
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 15 minutes

** Ingredients:
- 1Â¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- Â½ teaspoon baking soda
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
- Â½ cup raisins
- Â¾ cup buttermilk, or slightly more as needed

** Method:
1. Preparation:
2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
3. Mix thoroughly the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a large bowl with a whisk or spoon.
4. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the raisins. Using a large spoon, blend in buttermilk until a soft dough forms.
5. Place dough on a floured board and roll out to Â½ inch thickness. Using a sharp knife, cut dough into six squares, then cut each square again on the diagonal. Place triangles on ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown.

** Yield: Makes 12 scones.

 Buttermilk Syrup
* Ingredients
- Â½ cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 tablespoon Light karo syrup
- Â½ teaspoon baking soda

* Method
1. In a large pot or saucepan over medium heat add the butter, sugar, buttermilk, vanilla and karo syrup. Heat until everything is well combined and bring to a boil.  

2. Quickly remove the pot from the heat and add the baking soda, place back over the heat, stirring constantly. The syrup will grow large and threaten to boil over which is why a large pot is essential. If it gets too close to the edge remove from the burner and continue stirring to bring it down. 

3. Stir for 30 seconds over the heat (I often just take mine off so I don't risk boiling over) and serve immediately.

* Fruit and Nut Muffins
By Kim Carlson, from the Culinate Kitchen collection

Although I used to be a fan of super-sweet and cakey muffins, that's
no longer the case. But I still love the little package that a muffin
represents-- it's an easy snack.

I came up with this recipe, and although it contains only a relatively
little sugar, the fruit adds plenty of sweetness.

I hope you'll experiment with the amount of sugar you like.

Serve these muffins with butter and honey -- or not.


** Ingredients:
- 1 	cup whole-wheat pastry flour
- 1 	cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- Â¼ 	cup sugar (or less; see Note)
- 1 	tsp. baking powder
- Â½ 	tsp. baking soda
- Â½ 	tsp. salt
- 2 	large eggs
- Â½ 	cup low-fat buttermilk
- Â¼ 	cup canola oil
- 1 	cup ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 	cup frozen blueberries
- Â½ 	cup chopped and toasted nuts, such as hazelnuts (optional)

** Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-muffin pan with paper
   baking cups.
2. Combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in
   a large mixing bowl.
3. Whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and oil in a 4-cup glass
   measuring cup with a pour spout or a medium bowl. Stir in the
   mashed bananas.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a
   rubber spatula, stir just until blended. Fold in the blueberries
   and nuts.
5. Fill the muffin cups Â¾ full (add more batter to each cup if you
   have extra). Bake for 20 minutes, then check to see if the muffins
   are browning. If they need more time, bake 5 minutes longer.
6. Cool for 10 minutes before serving, or serve at room temperature.

** Yield: 	12 muffins

- I've made these muffins with just two tablespoons of sugar and
  without any sugar at all. Both options are good.

Repeat the coating the cooking process with the remaining slices of bread. (Do not overcrowd the pan.)

6. Serve the French toast immediately topped with maple syrup and the remaining diced strawberries.

*** Kellyâ€™s Note:
Any variety of bread will work in this recipe. A few of my favorites include a loaf of sourdough, a French baguette or (extra-thick) Texas toast. Use whatever type of bread you prefer, however stale bread works best for French Toast, as it absorbs the most liquid.
*** My Notes:
- [2016-07-17 Sun] Made for Colwills, Doris and TC. Good, but /way/ too lemony... even though I used about half the zest and none of the lemon juice.
