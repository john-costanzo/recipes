* Asparagus Frittata with Basil, Shallots and Parmesan

** Ingredients:
- 1 pound thin asparagus
- 2 Tbls extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 medium shallots, minced (onions will do in a pinch!)
- 6 large eggs -- egg beaters work just fine!
- Ω cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (I use Pecorino Romano)
- º cup shredded fresh basil leaves (I use 1 tsp dried)
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

** Method:
1. Snap and discard tough asparagus ends. Slice the asparagus on the bias into 1-inch-long pieces. Steam the asparagus in a bamboo steamer (or boil in salt water for 1Ω minutes), until almost tender.
2. Preheat the broiler. Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet with an oven proof handle. Swirl the oil to coat the bottom of the pan evenly. Add the shallots and sautÈ over medium heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and cook for 30 seconds. 
3. In a medium bowl, use a fork to lightly beat the eggs, cheese, basil and salt and pepper. Add the egg mixture to the pan and stir gently with a fork to incorporate the vegetables. Cook over medium-low heat, occasionally sliding a spatula around the edges of the pan to loosen the frittata as it sets. Continue cooking until the frittata is set, except for the top, about 8 minutes.
4. Place the pan directly under the broiler and cook just until the top is golden brown and set, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not let the frittata burn.
5. Invert the frittata onto a large platter. (Optionally sprinkle with a little kosher salt.) Cut it into wedges and serve. The frittata may also be cooled to room temperature and then cut and served.

* Crispy Red Potatoes with Warm Asian Slaw & Limey Sauce
** Overview
Welcome back to the Best Recipes of 2012! post-Thanksgiving edition. 4 days ago, most of us were no better than we should have been about the carbs, which is one of the reasons I saved this recipe till after the holiday.  The other is that it‚Äôs the kind of recipe there‚Äôs never enough of, and I figured there was no point in ratcheting up the level of family tension any more than necessary.

The book: The Fresh & Green Table, by Susie Middleton (Chronicle Books, $24.95 here‚Äôs my complete review)

The recipe: Crispy Red Potato Patties with Asian Slaw and Limey Sauce

Why I tried it: I have yet to meet anyone who can resist a crisp potato, and I‚Äôve long loved the way that roasting a potato gets you a whole lot of crunch with a minimum of oil.  Could there be another way to roast potatoes, other than the good ol‚Äô roasty chunks I learned to make from my trusty One Potato Two Potato?  The lime-and-gingery slaw sounded conventional, but it also seemed like a virtuous foil for the potatoes.

Why I loved it: First of all, the squashed potatoes have all kinds of surface area for crisping up, which they do with a vengeance.  Then it‚Äôs lime, lime, lime.  Tart lime and zest juicing up the soft mayo, lime brightening the fine shreds of cabbage in the slaw, all of it balanced with curve-filling sweetness just where it needs it.  The slaw is great, and it makes you feel good about yourself. But it was the crispy little bits of potato, perfect for dipping in limey sauce, that we were all fighting over in the end.  (If you feel like saving yourself some trouble and just making the potatoes and sauce and skipping the slaw, I assure you the recipe will still rock your socks off, and no one will know.)

** Time
- Estimated preparation time: 90 minutes, including a bit of downtime during which you can make the sauce and the slaw.

** Crispy Red Potatoes

*** Ingredients:
- 16 baby red potatoes of uniform size (about 1¬Ω oz each)
- kosher salt
- ¬Ω cup canola oil

*** Method:
1. To cook the potatoes: Preheat the oven to 475 degreesF. Line a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and top with a piece of parchment. Put a double layer of dish towels on a large cutting board or your counter. Arrange the potatoes (preferably in a single layer) in a large Dutch oven and add enough water to cover them by at least 1¬Ω inches. Add 2 tsp salt, cover loosely, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender all the way through but not falling apart (check with a paring knife), 18 to 20 minutes.

2. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer each potato to the dish towels, not touching, and let cool for a few minutes. Using another folded dish towel, gently press down on each potato to flatten it into a patty about ¬Ω inch thick (or up to ¬æ inch). The patties don‚Äôt have to be perfectly even, and a few pieces of potato may break off. (No matter; you can still roast them.) Let the patties cool for a few minutes more, transfer them to the baking sheet, and let them cool for 10 to 15 minutes longer. (Or, at this point, you can hold the potatoes in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 24 hours. Bring to room temperature before roasting.)

3. Sprinkle the potatoes with ¬º tsp salt and pour the canola oil over them. Care fully flip the potatoes over and season again with a scant ¬Ω tsp salt. Rub with some of the oil, making sure that the potatoes are well coated on all sides. Roast, carefully turning once with a spatula halfway through cooking, until they turn a deep orange brown (a little darker and crisper around the edges), 28 to 30 minutes.



** The limey sauce:


*** Ingredients:
- ‚Öì cup mayonnaise
- 1 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice
- ¬Ω tsp finely grated lime zest
- ¬Ω tsp finely minced garlic
- kosher salt



*** Method:
1. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, lime juice, lime zest, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Whisk until well combined. Let sit for a few minutes to let the flavors blend. Refrigerate if making ahead.


** The Asian slaw:
- 1¬Ω cups very thinly sliced napa or savoy cabbage (pale inner leaves only)
- 1 cup very thinly sliced red cabbage
- 1 cup (packed) baby spinach leaves
- kosher salt
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1¬Ω tsp freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1¬Ω tsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp canola oil, plus 2 tsp
- ¬Ω medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp minced peeled fresh ginger
- ¬Ω tsp minced garlic
- 2 tbsp thinly sliced scallions (white and green parts)

*** Method:
1. To make the slaw: In a large heatproof mixing bowl, combine the napa cabbage, red cabbage, and spinach. Sprinkle the greens with ¬º tSp salt. In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, lime juice, and brown sugar. In a medium heavy nonstick skillet, heat the 2 tsp canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the red onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until the onion is wilted and just starting to brown around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the onion to the bowl of greens and let the skillet cool for a few seconds off the heat.

2. Reduce the heat to medium-low, return the pan to the heat, and add the remaining 1 tbsp canola oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the vinegar mixture to the pan (scrape out all the brown sugar with a small spatula), stir vigorously to warm it through, and immediately remove the pan from the heat. Stir and scrape the hot dressing over the greens, tossing the greens with tongs as you pour. Toss thoroughly to coat well and to soften and wilt the greens just a bit. (The cabbage will still be crunchy.) Taste and add more salt (if desired).

3. Arrange four dinner plates on your counter. On one side of each plate arrange four potato patties, slightly overlapping. On the other side of eacplate, mound a quarter of the slaw. Spoon some of the limey sauce over the potatoes (down the middle of the rowof potatoes), and top each serving with the scallions. Serve right away.

Serves 4.

* Dried Mushroom Soup with Barley

** Ingredients:
- Ω ounce dried mushrooms, such as porcini, shiitake, chanterelle and/or morel -- about ‚Öî cup
- 6 cups boiling water
- 1 tsp canola or other vegetable oil
- 2 cups chopped onions
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed
- 1 cup finely chopped celery
- 1 cup carrots, peeled and finely chopped
- 3 cups sliced fresh mushrooms (about 10 oz.)
- º cup soy sauce
- pinch dried thyme
- º tsp ground black pepper
- Ω cup raw pearl barley
- º cup dry shery or 2 tsp honey
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

** Method:
1. In a saucepan, cover the dried mushrooms with 6 cups boiling water. Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside for at least 15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, warm the oil in a soup pot on low heat. Add the onions and garlic, cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the celery and carrots and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the fresh mushrooms, increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring continuously, for about 3 minutes, until the mushrooms begin to release their jucies. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3. Drain the dried mushrooms, reserving the mushroom stock. Cut off and discard any tough stems, then rinse and chop the mushrooms. Strain the stock through a sieve or-- if dirt or sand is evident-- through a paper coffee filter. Add enough water to the stock to make 7 cups of liquid. 
4. Add the chopped dried mushrooms, mushroom stock, soy sauce, thyme, pepper, barley and optional sherry or honey to the pot of sautÈed vegetables. Bring to a boil and then cover; reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
5. When ready to serve, add salt and pepper to taste. The soup should be brothy, so if it has cooked down and become thick, add a bit more water.

* Refried Bean, Zucchini and Corn Gratin
** Ingredients:
*** for the beans
- 3 cups simmered black beans or pinto beans, with liquid (see recipe)
- 2 tablespoons grapeseed or sunflower oil
- 2 teaspoons cumin seeds, ground
- 1 chipotle in adobo, seeded and minced (optional)
- Salt to taste
- 1 teaspoon mild or hot chili powder (more to taste)

*** for the squash:
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- ¬Ω cup minced onion
- Salt to taste
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 ¬Ω pounds zucchini or mixed zucchini and yellow squash, sliced about ¬º inch thick
- ¬Ω to 1 teaspoon oregano, preferably Mexican oregano, to taste

*** for the corn
- 2 cups corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
- 1 ¬º cups milk
- 1 serrano chile, minced
- ¬º cup cornmeal or polenta
- Salt to taste
- ¬Ω cup grated asadero, Monterey Jack or pecorino
- ¬º cup crumbled queso cotijo, queso fresco, or feta
- 1 tablespoon butter or extra virgin olive oil


** Method:
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Oil or butter a 2-quart baking dish or gratin dish.

2. Refry beans: Drain off about ¬Ω cup of liquid from beans, retaining it in a separate bowl to use later for moistening beans, should they dry out. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy nonstick frying pan and add ground cumin and chili. Cook, stirring over medium heat, for about a minute, until the spices begin to sizzle and cook. Add beans and optional chipotle. Fry beans, stirring and mashing with the back of a spoon, until they thicken and form a thin crust on the bottom of the pan. Stir up crust and mix into the beans. Cook until beans are thick but not dry, about 10 minutes. Add liquid you saved from the beans if they seem too dry. Taste refried beans and adjust salt (they probably won‚Äôt need any as the broth reduces when you refry them). Spread in an even layer in the baking dish. (Note: If you use canned beans, do not drain. The frying process will go more quickly.)

3. Clean and dry skillet. Heat over medium heat and add olive oil. Add onion and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add squash, oregano, salt and pepper, and turn up heat slightly. Cook, stirring often or tossing in pan, until squash is translucent and tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Spread in an even layer over the beans.

4. Combine corn and milk in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer 5 minutes, until corn is just tender. Stir in cornmeal and minced serrano, add salt to taste, and continue to simmer until mixture is thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in grated cheese. Remove from heat and spread in an even layer over squash. Sprinkle crumbled cheese over top. Dot with butter or drizzle on oil.

5. Place in oven and bake 25 minutes, until bubbly and crumbled cheese is lightly browned. Serve hot or warm.

Advance preparation: The refried beans will keep for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator, but you will need to moisten them before you assemble the gratin.

* Southwestern Quiche With Potato Crust 

** Ingredients:
- 6 large eggs
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1.5 cups frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed
- ¬Ω medium red bell pepper, diced
- ¬Ω cup fresh or frozen corn kernels, thawed if frozen
- 2 green onions (white and green parts), thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro
- ¬æ cup shredded or crumbled Cheddar cheese
- ¬Ω cup low-fat milk
- 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, w/ 2 tsp. sauce reserved

** Method:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat the pie dish with cooking spray. Whisk together 1 egg and ¬º tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Stir in shredded hash browns. Press the potato mixture into the bottom and sides of the pie dish to form crust. Bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.
2. Sprinkle the bell pepper, corn, green onions, cilantro, and cheese over the potato crust.
3. In a blender, mix together the remaining eggs, milk, ¬æ tsp. salt, chiles and adobo sauce. Pour mixture over vegetables in pie dish. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
4. Serves 6.
5. I served the quiche topped with avocado slices and good store-bought salsa (I had Mrs. Renfroís Black Bean Salsa on hand). It was quite tasty, and everyone wanted seconds. Iíll make this again, but I think next time Iíll serve it with some black beans or a salad on the side, to add some fiber, and maybe add a third chipotle pepper (love the smokey flavor they add).

* Pizza

** Master Dough with Starter
Makes about 29 ounces (820 grams) dough, enough for 2 pizzas This is what I‚Äôd call the quintessential American pizza dough, inspired by New York‚Äìstyle pizza: medium thin, satisfyingly chewy, and the ideal companion to mozzarella, tomato sauce, and the pizza toppings Americans love best, from pepperoni and sausage to olives, mushrooms, and other vegetables. It‚Äôs the dough I teach first to new students, and the one I recommend experimenting with because it‚Äôs so versatile and user-friendly.

*** Ingredients:
- 2.2 grams (¬æ teaspoon) active dry yeast
- 70 grams (¬º cup plus 1 tablespoon) warm water (80 degreesF to 85 degreesF)
- 453 grams flour (3-¬Ω cups) with 13 to 14 percent protein, preferably All Trumps, Pendleton Flour Mills Power, Giusto‚Äôs High Performer, King Arthur Sir Lancelot Unbleached Hi-Gluten, or Tony‚Äôs California Artisan Flour
- 10 grams (1 tablespoon plus ¬º teaspoon) diastatic malt
- 210 grams (¬æ cup plus 2 tablespoons) ice water, plus more as needed
- 90 grams Poolish (see sidebar) or Tiga (see sidebar)
- 10 grams (2 teaspoons) fine sea salt
- 5 grams (1 teaspoon) extra virgin
- olive oil

*** Method:
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the warm water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. The yeast should dissolve in the water and the mixture should foam. If it doesn‚Äôt and the yeast granules float, the yeast is ‚Äúdead‚Äù and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.

2. Combine the flour and malt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.

3. With the mixer running on the lowest speed, pour in most of the icewater, reserving about 2 tablespoons, followed by the yeast-water mixture. Pour the reserved water into the yeast bowl, swirl it around to dislodge any bits of yeast stuck to the bowl, and add to the mixer. Mix for about 15 seconds, stop the mixer, and add the poolish or tiga.

4. Continue to mix the dough at the lowest speed for about 1 minute, until most of the dough comes together around the hook. Stop the mixer. Use your fingers to pull away any dough clinging to the hook, and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a bowl scraper or rubber spatula. Check the bottom of the bowl for any unincorporated flour. Turn the dough over and press it into the bottom of the bowl to pick up any stray pieces. If the dough isn‚Äôt holding together, add small amounts of water (about ¬Ω teaspoon to start) and mix until the dough is no longer dry and holds together.

5. Add the salt and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute to combine.

6. Stop the mixer, pull the dough off the hook, and add the oil. Mix the dough for 1 to 2 minutes, stopping the mixer from time to time to pull the dough off the hook and scrape down the sides of the bowl, until all of the oil is absorbed. The dough won‚Äôt look completely smooth.

7. Use a bowl scraper to transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface, then knead it for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp dish towel and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. Use the dough cutter to loosen the dough and to cut it in half.  Weigh the dough, adjusting the quantity as necessary to give you two 13-ounce pieces. Form each piece into a ball. Any remaining dough can be discarded.

8. Form the dough into balls. Set the balls on a half sheet pan, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Or, if you will be baking the balls on different days, place each ball on a quarter sheet pan. Wrap the pan(s) airtight with a double layer of plastic wrap, sealing the wrap well under the pan(s). Put the pan(s) in a level spot in the refrigerator and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.


** TIGA and POOLISH Starters
Here are the two starters I use most frequently in this book and in my restaurants. Tiga is my slightly more hydrated version of a classic biga starter, which is usually between 50 and 60 percent water. This ‚ÄúTony‚Äôs biga,‚Äù which I call ‚ÄúTiga,‚Äù has 70 percent hydration.

My poolish follows the traditional proportions of equal parts water and flour, so its hydration is much higher at 100 percent. In general, unless I specify otherwise, use the same flour in your starter that you will be using in your dough. I always make starters with cold water to slow down the fermentation process for greater flavor complexity. It‚Äôs helpful to use a clear glass bowl so you can see how well your starter is fermenting.

*** TIGA
Makes 90 grams

**** Ingredients:
- 0.14 gram (one-third of ‚Öõ teaspoon) active dry yeast or 0.42 gram
  fresh yeast, broken into small pieces
- 39 grams (2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons) cold tap water
- 55 grams (¬º cup plus 3 tablespoons) flour used in dough recipe

**** Method:
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. The mixture should bubble on top. If it doesn‚Äôt and the yeast granules float, the yeast is ‚Äúdead‚Äù and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.

2. Add the flour and stir well with a rubber spatula to combine. The consistency will be quite thick.

3. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for 18 hours. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to cool slightly before using.

4. If you are not using the starter right away, you can store it in the refrigerator, though I suggest keeping it for no more than 8 hours. Bring it to cool room temperature before using.


*** POOLISH
Makes 90 grams

**** Ingredients:
- 0.12 gram (one-third of ‚Öõ teaspoon) active dry yeast or 0.36 gram
  fresh yeast, broken into small pieces
- 47 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold tap water
- 47 grams (¬º cup plus 2 tablespoons) flour used in dough recipe

**** Method:
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. The mixture should bubble on top. If it doesn‚Äôt and the yeast granules float, the yeast is ‚Äúdead‚Äù and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.

2. Add the flour and stir well with a rubber spatula to combine. The consistency will be quite thick, resembling a thick pancake batter.

3. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for 18 hours. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to cool slightly before using.

4. If you are not using the starter right away, you can store it in the refrigerator, though I suggest keeping it for no more than 8 hours. Bring to cool room temperature before using.

* Ultimate Veggie Burger Recipe
These make great do-ahead meals, and you can store shaped, ready-to-cook patties in the refrigerator for a week's worth of work lunches. Sprouted garbanzos are becoming more readily available, but if you can't find them, canned or cooked garbanzos (chickpeas) will work great. Sprouting boosts their already fantastic nutritional value even more...

** Ingredients:
- 2¬Ω cups sprouted garbanzo beans (chickpeas) OR canned garbanzos, drained and rinsed
- 4 large eggs
- ¬Ω teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- ‚Öì cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 onion, chopped
- Grated zest of one large lemon
- 1 cup micro sprouts, chopped (try brocolli, onion, or alfalfa sprouts - optional)
- 1 cup toasted (whole-grain) bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (or clarified butter)
Method:
1. If you are using sprouted garbanzos, steam them until just tender, about 10 minutes. Most of you will be using canned beans, so jump right in and combine the garbanzos, eggs, and salt in a food processor. Puree until the mixture is the consistency of a very thick, slightly chunky hummus. Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the cilantro, onion, zest, and sprouts. Add the breadcrumbs, stir, and let sit for a couple of minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a moist mixture that you can easily form into twelve 1¬Ω-inch-thick patties. I err on the moist side here, because it makes for a nicely textured burger. You can always add more bread crumbs a bit at a time to firm up the dough if need be. Conversely, a bit of water or more egg can be used to moisten the batter.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium low, add 4 patties, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes. Flip the patties and cook the second side for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Carefully cut each patty in half, insert your favorite fillings, and enjoy immediately.
3. Makes 12 mini burgers.

* Vegetarian Lentil Burger Recipe
These make great do-ahead meals, and you can store shaped, ready-to-cook patties in the refrigerator for a week's worth of work lunches. I use black lentils in this recipe, some of the other types of lentils are too mushy when cooked - so I'd stick with the black lentils. Feel free to spice up the batter by experimenting with your favorite seasonings.

** Ingredients:
- 3 cups cooked black lentils
- 4 large eggs
- ¬Ω teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup toasted fine (whole-grain) bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (or clarified butter)
** Method:
1. Combine the lentils, eggs, and salt in a food processor. Puree until the mixture is the consistency of a runny yet textured hummus - it's o.k. if many of the lentils remain whole (see photo). Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the onion. Add the breadcrumbs, stir, and let sit for a couple of minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. At this point, you should have a very moist mixture that you can easily form into twelve 1¬Ω-inch-thick patties. I err on the moist side here, because it makes for a nicely textured burger. You can always add more bread crumbs a bit at a time to firm up the dough if need be. Conversely, a bit of water or more egg can be used to moisten the batter.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium low, add 4 patties, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms begin to brown. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes. Flip the patties and cook the second side for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Carefully cut each patty in half, insert your favorite fillings, and enjoy immediately.
3. Makes 12 mini burgers.
