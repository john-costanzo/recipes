* Chocolate Chip Cookies

** Ingredients:
- 1 cup unbleached flour (I use King Arthur – organic if I can find it)
- 1 cup King Arthur white or regular whole wheat flour
- ½ cup quick cooking oatmeal (uncooked) I use what I have on hand, not necessarily quick cooking.
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1 tsp. coarse salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 1 lb premium quality bittersweet chocolate (see note below) cut into medium-sized chunks.
- 2 cups walnuts, coarsely chopped (the Supreme Cookie Dude aka Pat, likes big chunks of nuts and lots of ‘em)

** Method:
1. About the chocolate: I do not use chocolate chips because IMHO the better the chocolate, the better the cookie.
2. If I can’t afford the really good stuff I don’t make these. I like to use Valhrona bittersweet chocolate that comes
3. in thin bars (not sure of the weight but the bars are around 6” by 3” and maybe ½” deep -- I use several) so that
4. the chocolate is sort of in layers in the cookie. Scharffen Berger, Green and Black’s dark baking, and Callebaut
5. all work well. The best buy is from Trader Joe’s though (sorry, Jen!!!) and it’s their 1 lb. Plus bars which are
6. actually made by Callebaut. I use either the 72% (especially if making these cookies for adults) or the Dark
7. Chocolate (which is closer to semi-sweet and better for kids). But they also have the best price around on
8. Valhrona too.
9. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, oats, baking soda, and salt. In a large mixing bowl, cream together
10. butter and sugars. Blend in vanilla and egg. Slowly add in the flour mixture until nearly combined. Add in
11. chocolate chips and nuts and stir by in by hand (this is normally Pat’s job). It may seem like the dough won’t
12. handle all the chocolate and nuts but it does. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto baking sheets (I use one of
13. those cool cookie scoops that has the releasing mechanism) – you can put them very close together. Refrigerate
14. for 24 hours or longer (or freeze) then I take out only what I need for one pan at a time and bake on sheets.
15. These are great to have in the freezer to bake at a moment’s notice – do not thaw or allow to come to room temp
16. before baking.
17. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or use silpat sheets and preheat over to 350o. Bake one sheet at a
18. time for 7 minutes, then turn sheets around 180o and bake for another 6 minutes until lightly browned. (Your
19. oven may run hotter or colder than mine but this it what works in mine). Remove pan from the oven but leave
20. cookies on the paper and slip the paper onto a wire rack to cool. Since there’s so much chocolate in these and
21. it's in big pieces, if you take the cookies off the paper the chocolate will drip while it’s still hot.

** Yield Makes 48 cookies.

* Chocolate Cream Pie
** Ingredients
*** Crust
- 181g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- Â½ teaspoon salt
- 46g vegetable shortening
- 57g (Â½ stick) cold unsalted butter
- 28 to 57g ice water
*** Filling
- 28g unsalted butter
- 227g semisweet chocolate, chopped
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 131g granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 11g unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for richer chocolate flavor
- â…› teaspoon salt
- 3 large egg yolks
- 227g heavy cream, divided
- 454g milk
*** Topping
- 227g heavy cream
- 28g confectioners' sugar
- Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract
** Method
*** Crust
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, and salt.
2. Cut in the shortening until it's in lumps the size of small peas.
3. Dice the butter into Â½" pieces, and cut into the mixture until you have flakes of butter the size of your fingernail.
4. Add the water, two tablespoons at a time, mixing with a fork as you sprinkle the water into the dough.
5. When the dough is moist enough to hold together when you squeeze it, transfer it to a piece of wax or parchment paper. It's ok if there are dry spots in the pile. Use a spray bottle of water to lightly spritz these places; that way you'll add just enough water to bring the dough together without adding too much or creating a wet spot.
6. Fold it over on itself three or four times to bring it together, then pat it into a disk Â¾" thick
7. Roll the disk on its edge, like a wheel, to smooth out the edges. This step will ensure your dough will roll out evenly, without a lot of cracks and splits at the edges later. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.
8. To blind bake the crust: Preheat the oven to 400 degreesF. Lightly grease a 9" pie pan that's at least 2" deep. This will make serving the pie easier after it's finished.
9. Roll out the pastry for the pie to a 13" circle. Transfer it to the prepared pan, and trim the edges so they overlap the edge by an inch all the way around. Tuck the edges up and under, and flute them. Put the lined pie pan in the refrigerator to chill for 10 minutes.
10. Line the crust with foil or parchment paper, and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the crust for 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven, and gently remove foil or parchment with the weights or beans. Return the crust to the oven for 10 to 20 more minutes, until it's golden brown all over. If the edges of the crust start becoming too brown, cover them with a pie shield, or strips of aluminum foil. Remove the crust from the oven and cool completely.
*** Filling
1. Place the chopped chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract in a 2-quart mixing bowl; set aside.
2. In a medium saucepan away from heat, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa, espresso powder, and salt. Whisk in Â¼ cup of cold heavy cream until the mixture is smooth, with no lumps. Repeat with another Â¼ cup of the cream. Whisk in the egg yolks.
3. Place the saucepan over medium heat, and gradually whisk in the remaining cream and milk.
4. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly as the mixture thickens; boil for 1 minute.
5. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture over the reserved chocolate and butter.
6. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.
7. (optionally) Pass the filling through a strainer into a bowl to remove any lumps.
8. Place plastic wrap or buttered parchment paper on the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and chill thoroughly.
*** Topping
1. Place the heavy cream in a chilled mixing bowl.
2. Whip until the whisk begins to leave tracks in the bowl.
3. Add the sugar and vanilla and whip until the cream holds a medium peak.
4. Assembly
5. Transfer the cooled filling to the cooled, baked pie crust. Level the top with the back of a spoon or an offset spatula.
6. Spoon or pipe the whipped cream on top.
7. Chill the pie until ready to serve. Note: If you're not planning on serving the entire pie at once, top individual slices with a dollop of whipped cream just before serving.
**** Variation: Meringue topping
***** Ingredients
- 3 large egg whites (reserved from filling)
- pinch of salt
- Â½ cup (3Â½ ounces) sugar
- 3 tablespoons (1Â½ ounces) water
***** Method
1. Place the egg whites in a clean bowl with clean beaters. Add the pinch of salt.
2. In a small saucepan, bring the sugar and water to a boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Boil for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.
3. Whip the egg whites until they turn white and the whisk begins to leave tracks in the bowl. Slowly add the hot sugar syrup, and continue beating until the whites make stiff peaks.
4. Preheat the oven to 400 degreesF.
5. Pipe or spoon the meringue over the top of the filled, chilled pie, making sure you cover the filling completely.
6. Place the pie in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until the top of the meringue is golden brown. Remove from the oven and refrigerate until ready to serve

** Notes
*** <2016-02-28 Sun> 
Made at T's request. Good pie, but the crust was a bit hard/tough. Overworked and over cooked? 
Pudding was good. I used well-ground coffee beans and didn't strain it.

* Flaky Pie Crust
From the book How to Cook Everything by Mark Bittman

** Ingredients:
- For any single-crust pie, 8 to 10 inches in diameter. Double the recipe for a two-crust pie.
- 1? cups (about 5 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus some for dusting work surface
- ½ tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. sugar
- 8 Tbsp. (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into about 8 pieces
- About 3 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed

** Method:
1. Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in the container of a food processor; pulse once or twice. Add the butter and turn on the machine; process until the butter and flour are blended and the mixture looks like cornmeal, about 10 seconds.
2. Place the mixture in a bowl and sprinkle 3 tablespoons of water over it. Use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula to gradually gather the mixture into a ball; if the mixture seems dry, add another ½ tablespoon ice water. When you can make the mixture into a ball with your hands, do so. Wrap in plastic wrap, flatten into a small disk, and freeze the dough for 10 minutes (or refrigerate for 30 minutes); this will ease rolling. (You can also refrigerate the dough for a day or two, or freeze it almost indefinitely.)
3. You can roll the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap, usually quite successfully; sprinkle both sides of it with a little more flour, then proceed. Or sprinkle a countertop or large board with flour. Unwrap the dough and place it on the work surface; sprinkle its top with flour. If the dough is hard, let it rest for a few minutes; it should give a little when you press your fingers into it.
4. Roll with light pressure, from the center out. (If the dough seems very sticky at first, add flour liberally; but if it becomes sticky only after you roll it for a few minutes, return it to the refrigerator for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Continue to roll, adding small amounts of flour as necessary, rotating the dough occasionally, and turning it over once or twice during the process. (Use ragged edges of dough to repair any tears, adding a drop of water while you press the patch into place.) When the dough is about 10 inches in diameter (it will be less than ¼-inch thick), place your pie plate upside down over it to check the size.
5. Move the dough into the pie plate by draping it over the rolling pin or by folding it into quarters, then moving it into the plate and unfolding it. When the dough is in the plate, press it firmly into the bottom, sides, and junction of bottom and sides. Trim the excess dough to about ½ inch all around, then tuck it under itself around the edge of the plate. Decorate the edges with a fork or your fingers. Freeze the dough for 10 minutes (or refrigerate it for 30 minutes).
6. When you're ready to bake, prick it all over with a fork.

* Lemon Cornmeal Cake with Lemon Glaze and Crushed-Blueberry Sauce Glaze:

** Ingredients:
- 1Â½ cups (packed) powdered sugar, sifted
- 2 tablespoons (or more) fresh lemon Juice

- 3Â½ teaspoons baking powder
- Â½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon peel
- Â¾ teaspoon vanilla extract
- Â½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, cooled
- Crushed-Blueberry Sauce

** Method:

1) For glaze: Combine powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in small bowl. Stir with spoon until smooth and paste-like, adding more lemon juice by Â½ teaspoonfuls if glaze is too thick to spread. Set aside.

2) For cake: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350°F. Butter 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides; line bottom with parchment. Combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl; whisk to blend. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, lemon peel, and vanilla in small bowl. Pour buttermilk mixture and melted butter into flour mixture. Using rubber spatula, gently fold liquids into flour mixture until just blended (do not stir). Scrape batter into pan; spread evenly.
3) Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean and cake pulls away from sides of pan, about 30 minutes.
4) Immediately run knife around sides of cake. Place rack atop cake in pan. Using oven mitts, hold pan and rack firmly together and invert cake onto rack. Remove pan from cake. Place another rack on bottom of cake; invert 1 more time so that cake is top side up. Stir glaze until blended. While cake is still very hot, drop glaze by tablespoonfuls onto cake; spread to within Â½ inch of edge (some glaze may drip down sides of cake). Cool completely. Serve with Crushed-Blueberry Sauce.

* Pie Crust (Classic)

** Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- â…” - ¾ cup solid veg. shortening
- 4 to 5 tablespoons ice water

** Method:
1. Combine the flour and salt in a food processor. Add the shortening; pulse the machine on and off until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
2. With the machine running,trickle in 4 tablespoons of ice water through the feed tube, until the dough just gathers together. (If the dough seems dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more of ice water, ½ teaspoon at a time.)
3. Divide the dough in half, forming each half into a thick disk. Wrap each disk in plastic; refrigerate for at least 1 hour to chill.
4. Remove half the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about â…›-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate. (Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky.) With the help of a spatula, gently transfer the dough to a pie plate, pressing it lightly into the plate to fit. If the dough should tear, just press it together gently. Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. If making a single-crust pie, turn the edge under and flute it decoratively.
5. Repeat for a top crust or for another bottom crust. The diameter for a top crust should be one inch larger than for the pie.
6. Follow the individual pie recipes for filling and baking.

* Spoon Cookies
From Gourmet, Dec. 2005
Makes 25-30 sandwich cookies

** Ingredients:
- 2 sticks (1 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- ¾ cup sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- â…› tsp salt, slightly rounded
- ½ cup fruit preserves (your choice – cherry and strawberry are good)

** Method:
1. Fill kitchen sink with about 2 inches of cold water. Melt butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter turns golden with a nutlike fragrance and flecks on bottom of pan turn a rich caramel brown, 10 to 12 minutes. (Butter will initially form, then dissipate. A thicker form will appear and cover the surface just before butter begins to brown; stir more frequently toward end of cooking.) Place pan in sink to stop cooking, then cool, stirring frequently, until butter starts to look opaque, about 4 minutes. Remove pan from sink and stir in sugar and vanilla.
2. Whisk together flour, salt, and baking soda and stir into butter mixture until a dough forms. Shape into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap, and let stand at cool room temperature 1 to 2 hours (to allow flavors to develop).
3. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325F. 
4. Press a piece of dough into bowl of teaspoon (table type teaspoon, not one for measuring), flattening top, then slide out and place, flat side down, on an ungreased baking sheet. (Dough will feel crumbly, but will become cohesive when pressed.) Continue forming cookies and arranging on sheet. Bake cookies until just pale golden, 8 to 15 minutes. Cool cookies on sheet on a rack 5 minutes, then transfer cookies to rack and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Cookies are very delicate when hot.
5. While cookies cool, heat preserves in a small saucepan over low heat until just runny, then pour through a sieve into a small bowl, pressing hard on solids, and cool completely. Spread the flat side of a cookie with a thin layer of preserves. Sandwich with flat side of another cookie. Continue with remaining cookies and preserves, then let stand until set, about 45 minutes. Transfer cookies to an airtight contain and (this is the hard part) WAIT 2 DAYS BEFORE EATING.
6. Dough can be made 12 hours before baking and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature to soften slightly before forming cookies, about 30 minutes. Cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature 2 weeks.
