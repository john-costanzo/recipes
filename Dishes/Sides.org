* Champ

** Ingredients:
- 2 lbs. potatoes, unpeeled
- â…” cup milk
- 4-5 scallions, finely chopped
- ¼-½ cup butter
- salt and pepper

** Method:
1. Champ, also known as cally, poundies and pandy, is one of the most famous ways of serving Ireland's best loved vegetable--the potato. Champ is the country's way of serving mashed potatoes.
2. Heat a pan of salted water and boil the potatoes in their skins until tender. Drain and dry over low heat covered with a paper towel. Peel and mash well.
3. While the potatoes are cooking, put the milk and chopped scallions into a saucepan, bring to a boil, and simmer for a few minutes. Gradually beat the milk and onion mixture into the mashed potatoes to form a soft, but not sloppy, mixture. Beat in half the butter and searson with salt pepper. Divide among 4 warm plates or bowls. Make a well in the center of each serving, cut the remaining butter into 4 pieces, and put one piece in each of the hollows. Serve immediately.
4. Cook's notes:
5. Traditionally, champ would have been served as a main meal, with a glass of milk or buttermilk. Today, however, it is used to acocompany meats such as boiled ham and broiled sausages. Parsley, young nettle tops, peas and fava beans can be substituted for the scallions.
6. Serves 4.
7. Prep time: 5 minutes
8. Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
