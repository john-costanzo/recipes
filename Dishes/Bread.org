* New York Variation Pizza Dough

** Ingredients:
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 pkg dry yeast
- 3 ¼ cups unbleached flour
- ½ tsp salt
- Soften yeast in water. Add salt then start adding flour until a wet dough forms. Knead briefly, just to form a consistent dough. Place ball of dough in a large plastic Ziploc bag (or large bowl) that has been coated with olive oil. Place in refrigerator for 4-5 hours. About the time you turn the oven on to pre-heat, pull dough out of refrigerator. Punch down and then let rest for 10 minutes. Divide ball in half and coat well with flour. Start patting each ball of dough out into a circle, the thinner the better, letting rest if it won't spread out.
- Place an oven rack at the very lowest position – remove other racks and set aside. Place baking tiles or pizza stone on the rack and preheat the oven to 500 F for an hour or so. Make sure stone is in the oven from the beginning otherwise the high heat might crack it.
- New York Style Tomato Sauce
- 1 can (28 ounces) Italian plum tomatoes - buy the best you can find
- 2 tbl. tomato paste
- 1 or 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- 1 tsp. dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

** Method:
1. Crush the tomatoes with your hands or a fork and place in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the tomato paste, garlic, oregano and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture just to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until thick and flavorful, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the heat. (This may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen up to 4 months)
2. To bake: Turn the smoke alarm off. Cover pizza peel with coarse corn meal. Place one flattened piece of the dough onto the peel, spread with olive oil, cover with a thick layer of tomato sauce then add toppings. Sprinkle on a thick layer of parmesan cheese then drizzle with olive oil. Slide pizza onto the hot stone and bake 10 to 15 minutes until the top of the pie is beginning to brown. Remove pizza from oven and place on a cutting board. Let sit for a few minutes then slice and eat while hot.

* Rustic Bread
Makes 2 large loaves

** Ingredients:

*** Grains:
- Â½ cup wheat berries or cracked wheat (optional)
- Preferment:
- >12.5 oz. water (1Â½ cups)
- â…› teaspoon instant yeast
- 1 lb. bread flour (3Â½ cups)
- Â½ tablespoon salt

*** Final dough:
- 12.5 oz. water (1Â½ cups)
- Â½ teaspoon instant yeast
- 8 oz. bread flour (2  cups)
- 8 oz. whole wheat or rye flour or a mixture of them (around 2 cups)
- Â¼ cup or so flax meal (optional) 
- Â½ tablespoon salt
- all of the preferment 

** Method:
1. If using grains, soak in water, enough to cover, over night.
2. Put the yeast in the water and stir. Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl and pour in the yeasted water. Mix until the flour is hydrated, adding more water if necessary. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave the pre-ferment out at room temperature overnight (up to 16 hours... if you need more time before baking put it in the refrigerator).
3. To make the final dough, combine all of the ingredients except the pre-ferment in a mixing bowl. Chop the pre-ferment up into small pieces and mix or knead it into the final dough until they are thoroughly combined. This is quite difficult to do by hand: Hamelman assumes the baker has a mixer and can mix it for 5 minutes by machine. I mix and knead my dough by hand for about 10 minutes. At the end of that time the new and old dough aren't perfectly combined-- you can still see a few streaks of the lighter colored pre-ferment in it-- but they are sufficiently combined that loaves bake evenly.
4. Place the dough back in a greased bowl and ferment for 2Â½ hours, punching down or folding the dough twice during that time.
5. (Folding the dough consists of taking the dough out of the bowl, spreading it out a little on a clean surface, folding it in thirds like a letter, rotating it 90 degrees and folding it up again, and then returning the dough to the bowl and covering it again. Like punching down, folding degases the dough some, but it also encourages gluten development. More on this topic in a future post.)
6. At the end of the fermentation, divide the dough into two pieces and preshape each into a ball. Cover with a clean towel and let each rest for 5 to 10 minutes before shaping into the final shape. Once shaped, cover the loaves with a clean towel and set aside for a final rise, approximately 1Â¼ to 1Â½ hours.
7. Halfway though the final rise, begin preheating the oven to 450 degrees. If you are using a baking stone, preheat it as well. 8. Right before placing it in the oven, score the loaves. Place them in the oven and use whatever technique you use to create stream in the oven (squirt bottle, skillet full of hot water, etc) to encourage proper crust development.
9. After 20 minutes of baking, rotate the loaves 180 degrees so that they'll bake evenly. Bake until an instant read thermometer reads around 200 degrees, which took approximately 35 minutes for my batard ("football") shaped loaves.
