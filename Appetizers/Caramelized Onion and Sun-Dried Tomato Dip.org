* Caramelized Onion and Sun-Dried Tomato Dip
** Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons	olive oil
- 1 tablespoon	butter
- 4 cups		sliced mild onions
- ¼ teaspoon	dried rosemary, crumbled
- ⅛ teaspoon	dried thyme
- ⅓ cup		water
- 2 tablespoons	white wine
- 6			oil-marinated sun-dried tomato halves
- 1 tablespoon	chopped fresh parsley
- ½ teaspoon	capers (optional!)
- 6 small		pitted black olives (For best results use a good flavorful olive such as a kalamata.)

** Method:
1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil and the butter.
2. Add the onion; cook, stirring until softened about 2 minutes.
3. Stir in the the rosemary and thyme.
4. Lower the heat and cook slowly, uncovered, until onions are golden, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. [Don't try to hurry the onions; they'll know this and won't caramelize! -jc]
5. Add the water, wine, sun-dried tomatoes, parsley and capers (if you have to!). Bring to a boil.
6. Remove from heat and transfer to a food processor container fitted with a steel blade.
7. Add the olives. Cover and process until everything is finely chopped.
8. Variation: Substitute water for the wine.
