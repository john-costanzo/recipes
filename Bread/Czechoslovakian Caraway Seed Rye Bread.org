* Czechoslovakian Caraway Seed Rye Bread
** Ingredients:
- 2 packages (¼ ounce each) active dry yeast

- 1 tablespoon caraway seeds
- 1 tablespoon canola oil

2. Add brown sugar, caraway, oil, salt and remaining water; mix well.
3. Stir in rye flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour; beat until smooth.

5. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes.
6. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.
7. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
