* Pain Aux Raisins -- Paul Hollywood
** Ingredients:
- For the dough:
    + 350g strong white bread flour
    + 250g unsalted butter, chilled
    + 30g golden caster sugar
    + 7g fast-action dried yeast
    + 1 tsp salt
    + 125ml whole milk
    + 50ml warm water
    + 1 large egg, plus 1 beaten egg to glaze
- For the crème pâtissière:
    + 50g caster sugar
    + 2 large egg yolks
    + 20g cornflour
    + 250ml whole milk
    + ½ vanilla pod, split and seeds scraped out
- For the filling:
    + 100g raisins
    + ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
    + finely grated zest of 1 unwaxed orange
- For the icing:
    + 200g icing sugar, sifted
    + juice of 1 orange
** Method:
Step 1:
- Make the dough.
- Put the flour in a mixing bowl.
- Cut 25g of the butter into cubes, add these to the bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
- Add the caster sugar, yeast and salt and stir to combine.
Step 2:
- Beat the milk, warm water and egg together in a separate bowl and pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture.
- Mix with a wooden spoon to bring the ingredients together, then turn out the mixture onto the work surface and knead it with a dough scraper for 5 minutes, until you have a slightly sticky dough.
- Wrap the dough and chill it for 1 hour.

Step 3:
- Place the remaining block of chilled butter between 2 sheets of baking paper and flatten it out with a rolling pin to a rectangle measuring about 33 x 19cm (13 x 7.5").

Step 4:
- Lightly flour the work surface and roll out the chilled dough to a rectangle about 1cm (.39") thick and measuring 50 x 20cm (19½ x 7.9").
- With a short end of the dough closest to you, lay the butter on top of the dough, so that it covers the bottom two thirds.
- Make sure that it is positioned neatly and almost reaches the sides.

Step 5:
- Fold the exposed dough at the top (without the butter) down to cover half of the butter.
- Fold the bottom third of the dough (with butter) up over the dough – you will now have a sandwich of 2 layers of butter and 3 layers of dough.
- Pinch together the edges of the dough lightly to seal in the butter and turn the dough/butter parcel 90 degrees, so the long seam is on the left-hand side.
- Wrap the dough and chill it for 20 minutes to harden the butter.

Step 6:
- With the seam still on the left, roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle, about 1cm (.39") thick and 50 x 20cm (19½ x 7.9"), as before.
- With a short end of the dough closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top.
- Put the dough back in the fridge for 20 minutes.

Step 7:
- Make the crème pâtissière.
- While the dough is in the fridge, in a medium bowl and using a balloon whisk, whisk the caster sugar with the egg yolks, cornflour and 1 tablespoon of the milk until pale and combined.

Step 8:
- Gently heat the remaining milk with the vanilla seeds in a small saucepan until it just comes to the boil.
- Pour the hot milk into the egg mixture and whisk until well combined.
- Return the mixture to the pan and heat it gently, whisking continuously, until the mixture thickens to a custard consistency.
- Pour the crème pâtissière into a bowl, cover the surface and leave it to cool.
- Then, chill it until set.

Step 9:
- Finish the pain aux raisins.
- Remove the dough from the freezer, unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle about 1cm (.39") thick and 50 x 20cm (19½ x 7.9"), as before.
- With one of the short edges closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top.
- Roll out the dough to a 30cm (11.8") square.

Step 10:
- Spread the crème pâtissière over the dough, leaving a 2cm (.79") border on the side furthest from you.

Step 11:
- Sprinkle the raisins, cinnamon and orange zest over the crème pâtissière, then starting from the edge furthest from you, roll the dough towards you into a spiralled sausage shape, keeping it as tight as possible – give the dough a gentle tug each time you roll to tighten it up and give it a little tension.
- When you reach the end, roll the sausage back and forth a few times to seal the join.

Step 12:
- Cut the roll into 12 equal slices, each about 2.5–3cm (1") wide.
- Lay the slices, cut-side up and spaced apart to allow for rising, on the lined baking trays.
- Put each tray inside a proving bag and leave the dough to prove for 1 hour, until it has at least doubled in size.

Step 13:
- Heat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C fan/425°F/Gas 7.
- Brush the risen dough with beaten egg and bake the pains for 15–20 minutes, until golden brown and risen.
- If they look like they are over-browning, cover them with foil for the last 5 minutes of baking. Remove the pains from the oven and leave them to cool.

Step 14:
- Make the icing.
- Mix the icing sugar and 2 tablespoons of the orange juice to make a stiff but pourable icing.
- Drizzle the orange icing over the cooled pain aux raisins, then leave them for a few minutes for the icing to set before serving.
