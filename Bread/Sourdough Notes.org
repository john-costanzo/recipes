* Notes on Sourdough Starter
- Container weights (empty):
    + Mari's ice cream container (without the top) weighs 97g empty.
    + Chinese food soup quart container weighs something like 36g.
    + Deep red-top squarish bucket = 107g
    + Big Green Bowl = 114g
- 1 cup sourdough starter (unfed/discard) == 241g
- To refresh the starter:
    + Combine equal parts (by weight) of starter, flour and filtered water.
    + Let sit on counter for 2 hours and return to refrigerator.
- Tip: don't use more than, say, 200g starter + 200g flour + 200g water in Mari's ice cream container.
    + You can safely mix this amount of starter in the container, but not much more.
- Feed weekly.
