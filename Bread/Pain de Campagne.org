#+STARTUP: showeverything
* Pain de Campagne
** Ingredients:

3. Autolyse for 50 minutes.
4. Add salt.
5. Knead to medium gluten development.
6. Bulk ferment for 1 hour with a turn at 30 minutes.
7. Pre-shape dough and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
8. Shape final dough and put into well-floured banneton.
9. Let rise for about half an hour, covered.
10. Retard dough for 12 hours in the refrigerator.
11. Insert baking stone and preheat oven to 230 degrees C (= 446 degrees F) for 30 minutes.
12. Bake with steam for 15 minutes.
13. Reduce heat to 200 C (= 392 degrees F) and bake for a further 30 - 35 minutes until golden brown.
14. Cool completely on a wire rack.

- My starter was comprised of white flour and I used KA AP flour instead of bread flour and all of the levain.
- I skipped the 12 hour dough retard.
- I made a double batch.
- *Issue*: the two loaves ran together on the peel and stone. I had to saw them apart while they were in the oven.
- Good oven spring. Moist, with a nice crumb and not too sour (although T disagreed on the latter point).
- Made French toast the next morning, but, frankly, the bread was better as plain ol' toast.
