#+STARTUP: showeverything
* Poolish
Makes 90 grams of poolish.


** Ingredients:
- 0.12 gram (one-third of ⅛ teaspoon) active dry yeast or 0.36 gram fresh yeast, broken into small pieces
- 47 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold tap water
- 47 grams (¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons) flour used in dough recipe
** Method:
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl, add the water, and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds.

  The mixture should bubble on top. If it doesn't and the yeast granules float, the yeast is "dead" and should be discarded. Begin again with a fresh amount of yeast and water.

2. Add the flour and stir well with a rubber spatula to combine.

   The consistency will be quite thick, resembling a thick pancake batter.

3. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for 18 hours.
4. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to cool slightly before using.
5. If you are not using the starter right away, you can store it in the refrigerator, though I suggest keeping it for no more than 8 hours.
