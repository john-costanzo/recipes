** Method:
*** Crust:
1. Sift flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon into a bowl.
2. Cut butter and shortening with a fork or pasty cutter until mixture resembles rolled oats.
3. Moisten with just enough cider, tossing ingredients lightly with a fork, to permit the dough to be formed into a ball.
4. Wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.
5. Cut off on third of the dough and return it to the refrigerator.
6. Roll out the other two thirds between 2 sheets of wax paper (or plastic wrap).
7. Line a greased 9-inch pie pan with the dough.
8. Trim overhang and crimp decoratively.
9. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
*** Filling:
1. Peel, core and thinly slice apples.
2. Drop slices into a mixing bowl.
3. Whisk together sour cream, sugar, egg, salt, vanilla and flour in a small bowl.
4. Pour mixutre over apples and toss well to coat.
5. Spoon apples into pastry-lined pie pan.
*** Topping:
1. Mix sugars, cinnamon and walnuts together and sprinkle evenly over apple filling.
2. Roll out remaining pastry between sheets of wax paper to form a 10-inch circle.
3. Cut into ½-inch strips and arrange these lattice-fashion over apples.
4. Trim ends and crimp edge of crust decoratively.
5. Set pie on middle rack of the oven and bake for 55 to 65 minutes.
6. If crust browns too quickly, cover loosely with foil.
7. Pie is done when juices are bubbling and apples are tender.
8. Serve warm or cool, topped, if you like, with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

- Ok... The lattice crust. I just don't see it as worth the effort. Yes, it looks rustic and homey, but it's a lot of work. So I use the dough to make a solid crust. For that, I use about ⅓ of the dough for the bottom and ⅔ for the top.
