* East 62nd Street Lemon Cake
By Craig Claiborne
- TIME About 2 hours
- This is Maida Heatter's recipe
** INGREDIENTS
*** For The Cake:
- Fine dry bread crumbs or flour for dusting the pan
- 3 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature
- 2 cups sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons lemon zest
*** For The Glaze:
- ⅓ cup lemon juice
- ¾ cup sugar

** Method:
1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Butter a 9‑inch tube pan. Coat it with the bread crumbs.
2. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.
3. Cream the butter and sugar together. Beat in the eggs one at a time.
4. Fold in the dry ingredients alternately with the milk. Stir in the lemon zest. Pour the batter into the pan and smooth the top of the batter. Bake 1¼ hours, or until the cake tests done.
5. While the cake bakes, make the glaze. Warm the juice and sugar in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until all of the sugar is dissolved. Cover and remove from heat.
6. When the cake is done, immediately unmold the cake onto a cake rack and apply the glaze with a pastry brush to the top and sides of the cake until it is all absorbed.
** Yield
- 10 to 12 servings
