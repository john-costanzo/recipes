- 2¾ cup all purpose flour
- 2 t baking soda
- ½ t salt
- ½ t baking powder
- 1 cup butter
- 2½ cup sugar
- 4 eggs

*** Filling
- 1 cup heavy cream

** Method:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
- Butter and flour three 9" round cake pans (line bottoms with parchment or waxed paper).
- Combine cocoa with 2 cups boiling water, stirring until smooth.
- Cool completely.
- Sift together dry ingredients.
- In a large bowl beat together butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla.
- Alternate adding the dry ingredients and the cocoa mixture to the creamed mixture. Do not over mix. Blend just enough to moisten the dry ingredients.
- Divide the batter evenly into cake pans.
- Bake 25-30 minutes.
- Cool in the pans for 10 minutes then remove the cakes from the pans to cool completely before frosting.
- While the cake is cooling, prepare the frosting.
- In a medium saucepan, melt the chocolate and butter.
- Stir in the cream until smooth.
- Remove the pan from the stove and place it in a large bowl filled with ice.
- Using a whisk or electric mixer, beat in the powdered sugar until the frosting holds a stiff shape. Chill.
- Whip all the filling ingredients together until stiff. Chill.
- Construct the cake when all parts are cool.
- Spread the filling between the layers and the frosting on the top and sides.
- Plan to serve the cake soon after completion or provide a large space in the refrigerator to keep it cool until it is served.
