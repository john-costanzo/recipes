- 4½ cups vegetable stock (or water)
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 cups diced onions

** Method:
1. In a large pot, cook the lentils in the stock or water along with the salt and turmeric.
2. Drain but reserve the liquid.
3. Saute the onions, garlic and rest of the spices in the oil until the onions are golden brown, stirring continuously.
4. Mix the drained lentils with the rest of the spices and reheat gently.
5. When hot, stir in the coconut milk.
6. If the dhall is too dry or thick, add some of the reserved liquid.
7. For a lighter, less sweet version of this dish, substitute 1 cup chopped tomatoes for the coconut milk.
