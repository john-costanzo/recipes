** Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large green bell pepper diced
- 1 large red bell pepper diced
- 3 stalks celery
- 4 medium carrots peeled and diced (about 10 ounces)
- 3 large cloves garlic minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1½  teaspoons chili powder
- 1¼  teaspoons kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper plus additional to taste
- 1 small bunch kale trimmed and chopped (about 8 ounces)
- 2 cans (15-ounces) black-eyed peas about 3½  cups, drained and rinsed
- 1 can (14-ounces) fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- Prepared brown rice for serving
- Chopped green onions optional for serving
** Method:
1. Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat.
2. Add the red and green bell peppers, celery, carrots, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes.
3. Stir in the smoked paprika, chili powder, salt, and cayenne. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.
4. Working in small handfuls, stir in the kale, stirring after each addition to let it wilt slightly before adding another handful. Cook and stir until you can fit all of the kale in the pot.
5. Add the black-eyed peas and tomatoes with their juices. Stir and continue to cook until heated through, about 2 additional minutes.
6. Taste and add additional salt or spices as desired.
