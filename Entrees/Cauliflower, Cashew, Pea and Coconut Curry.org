* Cauliflower, Cashew, Pea and Coconut Curry
** Ingredients:
- 1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 green chile, roughly chopped (seeded if you prefer less heat)
- Kosher salt
- 4 tablespoons canola oil
- 2 large onions, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 ¼ teaspoons ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon chile powder
- 1 large head cauliflower (about 1 ¼ pounds), broken into bite-size florets
- 1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
- 4 ounces unsalted cashews (about ¾ cup)
- ½ cup frozen peas
- ½ teaspoon garam masala
- 1 small bunch cilantro, leaves chopped, for serving
- 1 lemon wedge, for serving
- Cooked basmati rice, for serving
** Method:
1. Place the ginger, garlic and green chile in a mortar and pestle with a pinch of salt. Mash until a paste forms and set aside. (Alternately, finely chop the ginger, garlic and green chile together, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, then mash into a coarse paste using the flat portion of your chef’s knife.)
2. In a large skillet with a lid, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium.
3. Cook the onions until golden, about 10 minutes.
4. Add the ginger paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.
5. Stir in the tomato paste, coriander, cumin, chile powder and 1¼ teaspoons salt.
6. Stir in the cauliflower and coconut milk and bring to a simmer.
7. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cauliflower is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet over medium.
9. Fry the cashews, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.
10. Add the peas and garam masala to the cauliflower mixture and cook, stirring, 5 minutes.
11. Season to taste with salt.
12. Top the curry with the cashews, cilantro and a squeeze of lemon just before serving.
13. Serve with a big steaming bowl of basmati rice.
