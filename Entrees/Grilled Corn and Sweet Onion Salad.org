* Grilled Corn and Sweet Onion Salad

** Ingredients:
- 12 ears of corn, husks and silk removed
- ¼ cup aged sherry vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- ½ cup olive oil, plus extra for brushing the corn
- 2 large red bell peppers, diced
- 1 large Vidalia onion, thinly sliced (or use a Maui or Walla Walla onion)
- 4 ripe plum tomatoes, finely chopped
- 1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
- ¼ cup finely chopped chives
- kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

** Method:
1. Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium.
2. In a large pot of boiling water, over high heat, cook the corn 5 minutes until barely tender. Brush with olive oil and grill until slightly charred on all sides, above 2 minutes.
3. Remove from the grill and with a sharp knife, scrape the kernels into a medium bowl, or stand each ear on a cutting surface and scrape downward to remove the kernels.
4. Combine the vinegar, mustard and garlic in a large bowl and slowly whisk in the remaining ½ cup olive oil until emulsified.
5. Add the corn kernels, bell peppers, onion and tomatoes, jalapeno and chives.
6. Toss to coat with the dressing.
7. Season with salt and pepper.

** Yield: makes 8 servings
