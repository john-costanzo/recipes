* Butternut Squash Soup

** Ingredients:
- 3 lbs butternut squash
- 7 Tbsp butter
- 2 leeks - thinly sliced (onions will do in a pinch!)
- 1 qt vegetable stock
- ¼ tsp nutmeg
- ½ cup peas (frozen or fresh)
- 8 cups fresh spinach (approx. ½ lbs = 10 oz. bag)
- 1¼ cup light cream
- salt and pepper to taste

** Method:
1. Slice squash length-wise in half. Place in microwave-proof pan with a small amount of water and microwave on high until flesh is tender (perhaps 20 minutes, depending on microwave).
2. Wash and drain spinach, trim stems, chop and set aside.
3. When squash is cool enough to handle, scoop out.
4. Melt butter in a stock pot and add leeks. Saute until soft. Add stock, squash, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. 
5. Puree soup in a food processor.
6. Return to pot and add spinach and peas. Simmer until spinach is slightly tender.
7. Stir in cream, heat and serve.
