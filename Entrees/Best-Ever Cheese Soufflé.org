- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard

** Method:
1. Gather ingredients.
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
3. Butter a 1 1/2-quart soufflé dish and coat it with 2 tablespoons of the Parmigiano-Reggiano.
4. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter.
5. Stir in flour to make a paste.
6. Gradually whisk in cream and bring mixture to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly.
7. Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking, until very thick, 3 minutes.
8. Transfer base to a large bowl; let cool.

10. Put egg whites in a large stainless steel bowl.
11. Add cream of tartar.
12. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites until firm peaks form.
13. Fold one-third of the whites into the soufflé base to lighten it, then fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.
14. Scrape mixture into prepared dish.
15. Run your thumb or a towel around the inside rim of the dish to wipe away any crumbs.
16. Bake for about 35 minutes, until soufflé is golden brown and puffed.
