** Method:
1. Preheat your oven to 425°.
2. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
3. Mix the sweet potato rounds with olive oil and sea salt then arrange them in a single layer.
4. Put them into your oven to roast for 20-25 minutes, or until they are soft.

While the sweet potatoes are cooking, make the rest of the frittata:

1. Heat the remaining teaspoon of olive oil over medium-high heat in an oven-safe pan.
2. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it has begun to brown.
3. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 more seconds.
4. Add the spinach to the pan and let it wilt then transfer the veggies to a bowl.
5. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the eggs, half of the goat cheese, milk, curry powder, and the remaining ½ teaspoon of sea salt.
6. Make a layer of sweet potatoes in the pan used for cooking the veggies.
7. Top it with half of the veggies then make a second layer.
8. Pour the eggs into the pan then dot the remaining ¼ cup of goat cheese on top.
9. Put the pan into the oven and let it cook for 25 minutes, or until the frittata has puffed up a little and is no longer runny.
10. Remove the pan from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes. Sprinkle the chopped almonds over the top.
