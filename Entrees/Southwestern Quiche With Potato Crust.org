    I served the quiche topped with avocado slices and good store-bought salsa (I had Mrs. Renfro's Black Bean Salsa on hand). It was quite tasty, and everyone wanted seconds. I'll make this again, but I think next time I'll serve it with some black beans or a salad on the side, to add some fiber, and maybe add a third chipotle pepper (love the smokey flavor they add).
