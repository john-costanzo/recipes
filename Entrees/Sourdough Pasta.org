* Sourdough Pasta
** Ingredients:
- ½ cup (138 g) sourdough starter, discard or fed
- 1½ cups (187.5 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
** Method:
1. Pour all the ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment and mix on low until it forms a ball.
2. Cover the dough in plastic and rest the dough for 30 minutes (up to overnight).
3. When ready to make the pasta, set the dough onto a floured surface and roll out with a rolling pin to get it as thin as possible (15-20 minutes).
4. Slice noodles to your desired thickness.
5. Drop noodles into boiling water for 3-5 minutes.
6. Drain and serve.
