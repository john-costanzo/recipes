* Hearty vegan 15‑bean soup with Southwest flavors
** Ingredients:
- 1 lb 15‑bean soup mix, seasoning packet discarded
- 4 cups low‑sodium vegetable broth
- 4 cups water
- 2 Tbsp low‑sodium soy sauce or tamari
- 1 medium sweet onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 2 ribs celery, chopped
- 1 bell pepper, chopped (any color)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1–2 Tbsp mild chili powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 can (14.5–15 oz) diced tomatoes (add after pressure cooking)
- 2–3 handfuls baby spinach or chopped kale (optional, after cooking)
- Juice of 1 lime
- Salt and black pepper to taste
** Method:
*** Prep beans and veggies
1. Rinse the beans thoroughly; remove any debris.
2. Chop onion, carrots, celery, bell pepper, and mince garlic.
*** Load the Instant Pot
1. You can skip sautéing here if you want fewer steps (the beans still pick up plenty of flavor), or quickly sauté onion, carrots, celery, and pepper in a bit of oil first for deeper flavor.
2. Add beans, broth, water, soy sauce, onion, carrots, celery, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cumin, thyme, and bay leaf to the pot.
*** Pressure cook
1. Lock lid, set valve to Sealing.
2. Cook on High Pressure for 45 minutes.
3. Let pressure release naturally, or wait at least 15 minutes then carefully quick‑release.
*** Add tomatoes and greens.
1. Open the pot, add diced tomatoes (with juices), spinach or kale if using, and lime juice.
2. Stir and let sit on Warm or Sauté (Low) for a few minutes to heat through and wilt greens.
*** Season and serve
1. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Soy sauce already contributes some salt and umami, so adjust gradually.
2. Serve with chopped cilantro, avocado, or a sprinkle of nutritional yeast if you want more savory depth.
