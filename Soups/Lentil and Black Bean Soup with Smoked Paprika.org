* Lentil and Black Bean Soup with Smoked Paprika
** Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ large onion chopped
- 2 large stalks celery diced
- 2 cloves garlic minced
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 bay leaves
- a 14-ounce can diced tomatoes
- 1 cup dried brown lentils
- 4¾ cup low-sodium vegetable (or chicken) broth, divided
- 3 cups water
- a 14-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
- ¼ cup chopped parsley
- salt and pepper to taste

** Method:
1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat.
2. Add onions and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are beginning to soften, 6 to 7 minutes.
3. Add garlic, smoked paprika and bay leaves and saute for 30 seconds.
4. Stir in diced tomatoes with juices, lentils, 3 cups broth and 3 cups water.
5. Increase heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil.
6. Reduce the heat slightly and cook, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender, 25 to 35 minutes.
7. Remove from the heat and let cool for about 10 minutes.
8. Remove and discard the bay leaves.
9. Transfer half of the lentil mixture, half of the black beans and ¾ cup broth to the bowl of a blender or food processor. Pulse until combined, but not pureed. It should be a chunky texture.
10. Pour the blender mixture back into the lentils in the saucepan, along with the remaining 1 cup of broth and remaining black beans.
11. Stir and reheat over medium heat.
12. Stir in parsley.
13. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
14. Serve.
