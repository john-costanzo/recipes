* CatchyMeals' Easy Sourdough Bread
** Ingredients:
- 225 grams of active sourdough starter (it should be bubbly and recently fed)
- 630 grams of room-temperature water
- 950 grams of bread flour (unbleached is best for flavor and structure)
- 23 grams of fine sea salt
** Method:
*** Mixing and Bulk Fermentation
1. Start by adding your water and sourdough starter to the mixer bowl.
2. Stir briefly, then add in the flour and salt.
3. Mix gently until a rough dough forms.
4. Let this rest for 30 minutes—this stage is called “autolyze” and helps the flour absorb moisture.
5. After the rest, knead with the dough hook for 30–60 seconds.
6. Then cover the bowl with a tea towel.
7. Every 20 minutes, repeat a short mix.
8. Do this 4 times in total. (This replaces traditional hand stretch-and-folds.)

   The dough will begin to look smoother and feel more elastic with each round.

*** Cold Ferment in the Fridge
1. After the final mix, transfer your dough to a large covered container and place it in the refrigerator. /This stage, known as “cold bulk fermentation,” slows everything down and builds flavor naturally./
   #+begin_note
   The dough can stay chilled for 24 to 48 hours, so it fits your schedule. No rush. No stress. When you open the container after a day or two, you’ll see a bubbly, strong dough that’s full of life and ready to bake.

*** Shaping and Proofing
1. When you’re ready to bake, gently turn the cold dough onto a lightly floured surface.
2. Divide and shape it into rounds or ovals, depending on your banneton size.
3. Dust the baskets with flour (you can also line them with tea towels if preferred) and place your shaped dough inside.
4. Cover with a clean towel and let it proof at room temperature for about 1 hour. /This resting time helps the dough relax and warm up before baking./
*** Baking with Steam
1. Preheat your oven to 475°F.
2. If using a Dutch oven, place it inside while the oven preheats to ensure it’s hot when the dough goes in.
3. Carefully flip your dough onto parchment paper, score it using a lame or razor, and place it into the Dutch oven or covered baking pan.
4. Bake covered for 20 minutes.
5. Then remove the lid and bake for an additional 20–25 minutes, until the crust is deep golden brown.

   To enhance the crust, toss a handful of ice cubes into an empty oven-safe pan on the bottom shelf during baking. The resulting steam helps the loaf rise and form a crackly, beautiful exterior.
