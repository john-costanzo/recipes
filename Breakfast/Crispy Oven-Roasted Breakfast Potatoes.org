* Crispy Oven-Roasted Breakfast Potatoes
** Ingredients:
- 2 pounds new potatoes (or other small potato)
- 1 tablespoon salt (for water)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- < ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- ½ to 1 teaspoon each of the following spices: Turmeric, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, fajita seasoning, smoked paprika
- 1 finely chopped jalapeno pepper, optional
- ½ finely chopped red bell pepper, optional

** Method:
1. Preheat oven to 450F.
2. Wash potatoes - but don't peel. Cut potato into fourths, or into bite-sized pieces.
3. Bring large pot of water to a boil, adding the salt and baking soda. Once water is boiling, add potato chunks. Boil for about 5 to 6 minutes, until potatoes are fork tender. Remove from heat and drain.
4. In a large bowl, combine olive oil and spices. Add cooked potatoes and toss to ensure even coating.
5. Place potatoes on a large baking sheet. Place in oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and use a spatula to gently move potatoes around and unstick any stuck potatoes, to ensure even roasting.
6. Return potatoes to oven and roast for an additional 30 to 40 minutes, until potatoes are cooked to your liking.
