#+STARTUP: showeverything
* Fruit and Nut Muffins
By Kim Carlson, from the Culinate Kitchen collection

Although I used to be a fan of super-sweet and cakey muffins, that's
no longer the case. But I still love the little package that a muffin
represents-- it's an easy snack.

I came up with this recipe, and although it contains only a relatively
little sugar, the fruit adds plenty of sweetness.

I hope you'll experiment with the amount of sugar you like.

Serve these muffins with butter and honey -- or not.


** Ingredients:
- 1 	cup whole-wheat pastry flour
- 1 	cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- ¼ 	cup sugar (or less; see Note)
- 1 	tsp. baking powder
- ½ 	tsp. baking soda
- ½ 	tsp. salt
- 2 	large eggs
- ½ 	cup low-fat buttermilk
- ¼ 	cup canola oil
- 1 	cup ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 	cup frozen blueberries
- ½ 	cup chopped and toasted nuts, such as hazelnuts (optional)

** Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-muffin pan with paper
   baking cups.
2. Combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in
   a large mixing bowl.
3. Whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and oil in a 4-cup glass
   measuring cup with a pour spout or a medium bowl. Stir in the
   mashed bananas.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a
   rubber spatula, stir just until blended. Fold in the blueberries
   and nuts.
5. Fill the muffin cups ¾ full (add more batter to each cup if you
   have extra). Bake for 20 minutes, then check to see if the muffins
   are browning. If they need more time, bake 5 minutes longer.
6. Cool for 10 minutes before serving, or serve at room temperature.

** Yield: 	12 muffins

- I've made these muffins with just two tablespoons of sugar and
  without any sugar at all. Both options are good.
