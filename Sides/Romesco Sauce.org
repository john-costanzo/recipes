* Romesco Sauce
** Ingredients:
- one 16-ounce jar of roasted red peppers, drained
- ½ cup raw or roasted almonds (unsalted)
- ¼ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, rinsed and drained
- 2 medium-to-large cloves garlic, peeled and quartered
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt, to taste
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
** Method:
1. In a blender (preferably) or food processor, combine everything but the olive oil. Securely fasten the lid and blend, starting on low and increasing the speed as you are able to gain traction.
2. Once the ingredients are mostly blended, start drizzling in the olive oil while running the blender. Blend until you reach your desired consistency (I like my Romesco sauce pretty creamy, but you might prefer it with a more chunky texture).
3. Taste, and add additional salt (up to ¼ teaspoon) if it doesn’t quite knock your socks off yet.
4. Serve immediately, or store in a jar in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.
