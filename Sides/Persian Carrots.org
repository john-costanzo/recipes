- 8 fresh dates
- 2 tbs olive oil

Original recipe makes 4 Servings

*** Method
1. This side dish with a difference goes very well with plainly grilled or roasted chicken or braised lamb.
2. Wash 3 large or 4 medium carrots and slice into rounds.
3. Peel one onion and slice. 
4. Stone 8 fresh dates (or substitute dried) and cut into slices lengthwise.
5. Have ready 4 tablespoons of currants or sultanas.
6. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a wide saucepan. Add all the prepared ingredients and stir-fry for a minute or two, then add 100 mL water, cover and bring to a fast boil. Add salt to taste and put back the lid at an angle so that steam can escape. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender and the water has evaporated. If water remains, remove the lid and raise the heat to dry it off.
7. Serve.
