* Broccoli Salad With Garlic and Sesame
This salad is made from uncooked broccoli tossed with an assertive garlic, sesame, chile and cumin-seed vinaigrette slicked with good extra-virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar. The acid “cooks” the florets a little as ceviche does fish. After an hour, the broccoli softens as if blanched, turning bright emerald, and soaking up all the intense flavors of the dressing. You’ll be making this one again.

** Ingredients:
- 1½ teaspoons red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste
- 2 heads broccoli, 1 pound each, cut into bite-size florets
- ¾ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 4 fat garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
- 2 teaspoons roasted (Asian) sesame oil
- Large pinch crushed red pepper flakes

** Method:
1. In a large bowl, stir together the vinegar and salt.
2. Add broccoli and toss to combine.
3. In a large skillet, heat olive oil until hot, but not smoking.
4. Add garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
5. Stir in sesame oil and pepper flakes.
6. Pour mixture over broccoli and toss well.
7. Let sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature, and up to 48 (chill it if you want to keep it for more than 2 hours).
8. Adjust seasonings (it may need more salt) and serve.
** Yield:
6 to 8 servings
