* Black Beans in Instant Pot
** Ingredients:
- 1 pound (about 2 cups) dried black beans, soaked 8–12 hours, then drained and rinsed
- ​4 cups water or low‑sodium broth (enough to cover by about 1 inch)
- ​½ onion, chopped (optional but recommended)
- ​3 cloves garlic, minced or lightly crushed
- ​1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ​1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ​½–1 teaspoon chili powder or red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)
- ​1–1½ teaspoons kosher salt, added before or after cooking to taste
- ​¼ teaspoon black pepper (optional)
** Method:
1. For firmer beans (good for salads): cook on High Pressure for 8–9 minutes, then natural release 15 minutes before venting.
2. For softer, creamier beans: cook on High Pressure for 10–11 minutes, then natural release 15 minutes before venting.
