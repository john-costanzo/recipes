* Dreena Burton’s Easy 3-Bean Salad
** Ingredients:
- 1 medium apple, peeled if desired, cored, and chopped (¾ cup)
- ½ teaspoon lemon juice
- 4 cups cooked chickpeas, kidney beans, and black beans, rinsed and drained if using canned
- 1 cup chopped green and/or red bell pepper
- ½ cup sliced scallions (mostly green parts)
- ¼ cup finely chopped celery
- 3½ tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
- 1 to 1½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Pinch ground cloves, plus more to taste (/optional/)
** Method:
1. In a large bowl combine apple and lemon juice; toss to coat. (This will help preserve the color of the apple.)
2. Add the remaining ingredients; toss to combine.
3. If you like, season with additional salt and black pepper.
