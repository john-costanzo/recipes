* Oat Milk
** Ingredients:
- 6 cups water
- 1 cup whole rolled oats
- 4 teaspoons maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ½ cup flaked coconut (/optional/)
** Method:
1. Combine the oats, water, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt in a high-powered blender and blend for 20 seconds.
2. Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and strain the milk without pushing any excess pulp through the strainer. This will create a creamier texture that’s not gritty or gummy.
3. Add more maple syrup, to taste, if desired. Chill overnight.

   If you want to drink your oat milk right away, I recommend adding ice - it's flavor is best when well chilled.

As the oat milk sits in the fridge, natural separation will occur. You can shake it, if you like, but I like it's texture best when I leave pulp at the bottom and pour off the top.
