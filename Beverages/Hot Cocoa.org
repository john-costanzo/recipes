* Hot Cocoa
** Method
/For a 12 oz serving/
- Boil 8 oz boiling water
- 4 TBS (¼ cup, 30g) powdered Whole milk 
- 2 or up to 3 TBS (30-45g) cane sugar (or brown) *
- Add 3 TBS (27g) full fat cocoa
- Stir like mad! If it ain’t mixed now, too late.

- Now, the balance is up to you, I add 4 oz. ½ and ½
- ...or you can add 4 oz. milk.
- Heat the whole mixture and serve.

​* This recipe is awfully sweet. Consider using less sugar: perhaps 20-25g.

- [2020-03-18 Wed] I use brown sugar, but keep it toward the lower end. I use half half-and-half and half almond milk. Miss T seems to like it!
